- trillions of examples of text from the internet.

3.

True or False. Because an LLM has learned from web pages on the internet, its answers are always more

1 / 1 point

trustworthy than what you will find on the internet.

True

False

Correct
Because LLMs can hallucinate (make up facts), it is best to fact-check the response from an LLM before

using it in situations where factual accuracy is important.

4. Why do we call AI a general purpose technology?

1 / 1 point

Because it is useful for many different tasks.

Because it can chat.

Because it includes both supervised learning and generative AI.

Because it can be accessed via the general web.

Correct
General purpose technologies are, by definition, designed to be versatile and useful for a wide range

of tasks. This broad utility across various applications is what characterizes AI as a general purpose
technology.

5.

You hear of a company using an LLM to automatically route emails to the right department. Which of these

1 / 1 point

use cases is it most likely to be?

The company has a software-based application that uses an LLM to automatically route emails.

Employees are copy-pasting the emails into a web interface to decide how to route them.

Correct
A software-based application that uses an LLM to automatically read and route emails can process

many emails automatically as they are received. So it is most likely the company is using a software-

based application to carry out this work.
